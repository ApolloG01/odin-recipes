    <p>
      Rivers Native Soup is a gift from the people of Rivers State in the Niger
      Delta Area of Nigeria.<br/> These are the riverine people that use the freshest
      seafood to prepare expensive soups and meals.<br/> But you do not have to break
      a bank to prepare this soup if you are not a fisherman.<br/> You can cut down
      on some of the ingredients but whatever you do, make sure you add clams
      because it adds a lot of flavour to this soup.
