        Bouye juice is a delightful and creamy Gambian beverage made from the baobab fruit, which is native to the African continent. This refreshing drink is known for its rich and unique flavor, combining the natural sweetness of the baobab fruit with the creamy texture of evaporated milk. Bouye juice is a popular choice to quench thirst and cool down in the hot Gambian climate.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup baobab fruit pulp</li>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>1 cup evaporated milk or condensed milk</li>
      <li>¼ cup sugar (adjust according to taste)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon vitamin C powder (optional)</li>

    <li>In a blender, combine the baobab fruit pulp and water. Blend on high speed until the mixture is smooth and well-combined.</li>

    <li>Garnish each glass with fresh mint leaves for added freshness and aroma.</li>
