    <p>
        The origin of stews like oxtail can be traced back to our colonial heritage. Enslaved Africans on plantations were given very meager amounts of protein and often had to make do with cheaper cuts of meat or ends of slaughtered animals to add protein to their diets. This is why so many Jamaican dishes have ingredients like pigâ€™s tail, cow foot, chicken foot, tongue, and organs, like liver, tripe, etc. Jamaica does not have an extensive cattle-farming past; we have always had a stronger tradition of pig farming, which means that beef of any kind, and in particular fresh beef, would have been viewed as a rare treat indeed. The island was not known for its high quality meats; the intense heat and tropical climate meant that everything spoiled very quickly, and therefore, everything had to be cured, pickled, preserved, or stewed in brine. When an animal was slaughtered fresh, the tail, skin, hooves, and all the other parts that were of little use to wealthy plantation owners became delicacies for the workers who would preserve as much of the meat as possible for storage or sale, then prepare a shared feast with the rest.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>Remove oxtail from marinade and scrape off excess marinade. Reserve marinade for later use.</li>
      <li>3 scallions, root ends trimmed and cut into 2-inch segments</li>
      <li>4 medium cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 Scotch bonnet pepper, stemmed, seeded, and chopped</li>
      <li>3 pounds (1.4kg) oxtail</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon picked fresh thyme leaves
    </li>
    
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li><b>For the Marinated Oxtail:</b> In a blender, combine onion, scallion, garlic, and Scotch bonnet with 1/2 cup (120ml) water and blend until thoroughly pureed. Rub oxtail all over with soy sauce, salt, pepper, and thyme. Transfer oxtail to a large bowl or large zipper-lock bag and pour blended aromatics on top. Mix well to coat, then cover bowl or seal bag, pushing out air as you go. Refrigerate for 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Remove oxtail from marinade and scrape off excess marinade. Reserve marinade for later use.</li>
    <li><b>For the Stew:</b> In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pot, add oxtail and cook until browned all over, about 5 minutes per side (oxtail will brown more quickly and deeply due to the marinade, but turn down heat if it threatens to burn). Transfer oxtail to a platter and repeat with remaining oxtail, adding more oil to the pot if necessary.</li>
    <li>Add 1 cup (240ml) water to Dutch oven and bring to a simmer, scraping bottom of pot to remove any browned bits. Return oxtail and any juices to the pot.</li>
    <li>Add onions, scallion, garlic, thyme, Scotch bonnet pepper, and browning or soy sauce to oxtail. Add just enough water to cover meat, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat, cover, and let simmer for 40 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add reserved oxtail marinade to pot and stir to combine. Continue to gently simmer, uncovered, adding a little water from time to time to ensure oxtail remains just barely covered, until oxtail is tender, about 2 hours.</li>
    <li><b>For the Spinners (Optional) and to Finish:</b> If making spinners: In a small bowl, whisk together flour and a large pinch of salt. Add 1/2 cup (118ml) cold water and knead until a sticky dough ball forms. Cover and let rest 15 minutes. Tear off small pieces of dough and roll them into cigarette-sized strips. Stir into oxtail.</li>
    <li>Stir in butter or broad beans and let simmer until stew is thickened, about 30 minutes. Remove thyme sprigs.</li>
    <li>Add black pepper, season with salt, and serve with white rice or rice and peas, plantain, sliced avocado, and a nice fresh green salad.</li>
